# Introduction

The `r Githubpkg("steveped/incucyteR")` package is designed to enable easy 
import, visualisation and analysis of Incucyte data. This package is primarily 
focussed on assays that measure either cell growth or cell death.

# Importing Data

`incucyteR` can import multiple assays as well as the PlateMap files 
directly exported by the Incucyte software. Any CellType, GrowthCondition or 
other metadata included in the PlateMap will be added to the data object 
during import, and a well documented PlateMap can significantly simplify 
analysis.

Data will be imported as an `IncucyteExperiment` object, which is based on the
`r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` object class.
